Start with the Tile Resource - just the base properties (biome, base stats, etc.)
Then the visual hexagon scene - what you see on the board
Later we can build the Game Manager that tracks ownership and calculates totals

Should I go ahead and create the first script for the Tile Resource?
What base stats do you want to include? So far you mentioned:

Biome type
Population (growth rate?)
Attack rating
Defense rating


Perfect! I've created the GameManager script. Let me explain what it does:
Key Features:
Player Data Structure
Each player has:

current_population - their total population (starts at 10,000)
population_growth_rate - base growth rate (starts at 0.8%)
current_army_size - how many in military
tiles_owned - array of tiles they control

Main Functions
Setup:

initialize_game(num_players) - starts a new game with X players

Tile Management:

register_tile(tile) - add tiles to the game
assign_tile_to_player(tile, player_id) - conquest/claiming
get_player_tiles(player_id) - get all tiles a player owns

Stats Calculation:

calculate_population_growth_modifier(player_id) - sums tile bonuses
calculate_total_attack_modifier(player_id) - sums attack from tiles
calculate_total_defense_modifier(player_id) - sums defense from tiles

Population Management:

update_player_population(player_id) - grows population for one player
update_all_populations() - grows for all players (call each turn)
set_player_army_size(player_id, size) - when allocating to military

Turn System:

next_turn() - advances turn and updates all populations

Utility:

get_player_summary(player_id) - returns all stats as a dictionary
print_all_player_stats() - debug function to see everything

How Population Growth Works:
Effective Growth = Base Rate (0.8%) + (Tile Bonuses / 100)
New Population = Current Population Ã— (Effective Growth / 100)
Signals:

player_stats_changed(player_id) - when stats update (for UI)
tile_ownership_changed(tile, old_owner, new_owner) - when tiles change hands
